EXTRACTION_PROMPT_V2 = """You are an expert knowledge extraction AI. Your task is to transform this document into structured, interconnected knowledge components that eliminate the need for manual reading and analysis.

DOCUMENT TO ANALYZE:
{full_text}

EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:

Extract information following this EXACT schema. Every field is required, use empty arrays/null if no data exists.

=== 1. QUOTES ===
Extract meaningful quotes, statements, declarations, key findings, conclusions, or important claims.

Schema for each quote:
{{
  "id": "q1" | "q2" | "q3"...,  // Sequential IDs starting with q
  "text": "exact verbatim quote text",  // Must be word-for-word from document
  "author": "name" | "unknown" | "document",  // Who said/wrote it
  "context": "brief description of surrounding context",
  "page": number | null,  // Page number if available
  "importance": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "type": "statement" | "finding" | "conclusion" | "claim" | "definition",
  "entity_ids": ["e1", "e2"],  // IDs of entities mentioned IN this quote
  "metric_ids": ["m1", "m2"],  // IDs of metrics mentioned IN this quote
  "keywords": ["word1", "word2"]  // Key terms for searchability
}}

=== 2. ENTITIES ===
Extract all significant entities: people, organizations, places, products, concepts, technologies, methodologies.

Schema for each entity:
{{
  "id": "e1" | "e2" | "e3"...,  // Sequential IDs starting with e
  "name": "full entity name",
  "type": "person" | "organization" | "place" | "product" | "concept" | "technology" | "methodology",
  "description": "concise but informative description",
  "importance": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "first_mentioned_page": number | null,
  "aliases": ["alternative name 1", "acronym"],  // Other ways this entity is referenced
  "attributes": {{  // Type-specific attributes
    "role": "if person",
    "industry": "if organization", 
    "location": "if place",
    "category": "if product/concept"
  }},
  "quote_ids": ["q1", "q3"],  // IDs of quotes where this entity appears
  "metric_ids": ["m1", "m4"],  // IDs of metrics associated with this entity
  "related_entity_ids": ["e2", "e5"]  // Other entities frequently mentioned together
}}

=== 3. METRICS ===
Extract all quantitative data: numbers, percentages, dates, timeframes, measurements, statistics, KPIs, financial figures.

Schema for each metric:
{{
  "id": "m1" | "m2" | "m3"...,  // Sequential IDs starting with m
  "value": "123.45" | "2023-01-15" | "Q4 2023",  // The actual number/date/period
  "unit": "%" | "$" | "years" | "units" | "people" | null,
  "type": "percentage" | "currency" | "date" | "quantity" | "ratio" | "timeframe",
  "context": "what this metric represents and why it matters",
  "category": "financial" | "performance" | "demographic" | "temporal" | "operational",
  "trend": "increasing" | "decreasing" | "stable" | null,
  "significance": "high" | "medium" | "low",
  "entity_ids": ["e1"],  // Entities this metric relates to
  "quote_ids": ["q2"],  // Quotes where this metric appears
  "comparison_baseline": "what this is compared against, if any"
}}

=== 4. RELATIONS ===
Extract explicit relationships between entities mentioned in the document.

Schema for each relation:
{{
  "source_entity_id": "e1",
  "target_entity_id": "e2",
  "type": "owns" | "works_for" | "competes_with" | "partners_with" | "located_in" | "created_by" | "influences" | "depends_on" | "subsidiary_of" | "collaborates_with",
  "description": "detailed description of the relationship",
  "strength": "strong" | "moderate" | "weak",
  "evidence_quote_ids": ["q1"],  // Quotes that support this relationship
  "temporal": "current" | "historical" | "planned" | "unknown"
}}

CRITICAL RULES:
1. COMPLETENESS: Extract ALL significant quotes, entities, and metrics. Don't be selective.
2. ACCURACY: Only extract what's explicitly stated. Don't infer or assume.
3. CROSS-REFERENCES: Maintain bidirectional references between quotes, entities, and metrics.
4. ID CONSISTENCY: Use sequential IDs (q1, q2... e1, e2... m1, m2...) and reference them correctly.
5. VALIDATION: Ensure every referenced ID exists in its respective array.
6. NO HALLUCINATION: If information isn't clear, use null or empty arrays rather than guessing.
7. CONTEXT PRESERVATION: Maintain enough context so each item is understandable standalone.

ERROR HANDLING:
- If a quote can't be extracted verbatim, paraphrase and mark type as "paraphrase"
- If an entity's type is unclear, use "concept"
- If a metric's significance is unclear, use "medium"
- If relationships are implied but not explicit, don't include them

QUALITY TARGETS:
- Aim for 15-50 quotes depending on document length
- Aim for 10-100 entities depending on document complexity  
- Aim for 5-30 metrics depending on data density
- Aim for 5-20 relations depending on entity interconnectedness

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return a valid JSON object with exactly these four top-level keys: "quotes", "entities", "metrics", "relations"

Example structure:
{{
  "quotes": [...],
  "entities": [...], 
  "metrics": [...],
  "relations": [...]
}}
